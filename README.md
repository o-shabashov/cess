# Check External Service'S

[![BCH compliance](https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/o-shabashov/cess?branch=master)](https://bettercodehub.com/)

Checking external services, whether they are alive or not.

## TL;DR
```shell
bin/cess.sh
nano config.json
bin/cess.sh
```

Suppose you are working on a project that uses 2 databases and 3 different API. So, to quickly check whether they fell or not, you can run CESS.

Of course, first edit the config.json to your needs.

## Install dependencies

```shell
glide up
```

## Edit config.json

## Run

```shell
go run main.go
```
